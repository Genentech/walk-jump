# discrete Walk-Jump Sampling (dWJS)

This is the official open source repository for [discrete Walk-Jump Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12360) developed by [ncfrey](https://github.com/ncfrey), [djberenberg](https://github.com/djberenberg), [kleinhenz](https://github.com/kleinhenz), and [saeedsaremi](https://github.com/saeedsaremi), from [Prescient Design, a Genentech accelerator.](https://gene.com/prescient)

## Setup
Assuming you have [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) installed, clone the repository, navigate inside, and run:
```bash
./scripts/install.sh
```

### Training
The entrypoint `train` is the main driver for training and accepts parameters using Hydra syntax.
The available parameters for configuration can be found by running `train` --help or by looking in the `src/walkjump/hydra_config` directory

### Sampling
The entrypoint `sample` is the main driver for training and accepts parameters using Hydra syntax.
The available parameters for configuration can be found by running `sample` --help or by looking in the `src/walkjump/hydra_config` directory
